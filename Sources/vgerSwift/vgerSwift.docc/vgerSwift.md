# ``vgerSwift``

Vector graphics renderer for dynamic UIs.

## Overview

vger is a vector graphics renderer which renders a limited set of primitives, but does so almost entirely on the GPU. Works on iOS and macOS. API is plain C.

Each primitive can be filled with a solid color, gradient, or texture. vger renders primitives as instanced quads, with most of the calculations done in the fragment shader.
