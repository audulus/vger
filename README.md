# vger

vger is a vector graphics renderer which renders a limited set of primitives, but does so entirely on the GPU using a single draw call.

* Circle
* Arc
* Rounded Rect
* Quadratic Bezier stroke
* Line Segment
* Text

Each primitive can be filled with a solid color, or a texture (gradients are forthcoming).
